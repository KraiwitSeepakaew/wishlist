(2)Storage cleanup: This feature allows you to scan the file folders on your device and then clean it up based on the analysis results, such as clearing the cache and recycle bin with just one tap and deleting similar or burst photos, large videos, large files, and other unneeded files.
(3)Virus scan: This feature helps to comprehensively identify and block malicious apps, such as apps that may contain viruses or lead to fraud, thus protecting your device from security and privacy risks.
